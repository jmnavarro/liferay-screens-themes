# Liferay Screens Themes
This repo contains a set of themes to be used with [Liferay Screens](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/).

The main aim is to release a collection of sample themes to show how they can be created.

## Installation
Just download the theme folder and drag&drop into your Liferay Screens projects.

As soon as CocoaPods is ready to work with Swift, anyone will be able to release their own theme as a Pod.
